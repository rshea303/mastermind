# A sequence of four colored pegs is chosen by the code maker and placed within
# the code shield. The sequence can incorporate one to four different colors.
#
# Most Mastermind boards include at least six different colors of pegs, which
# means that not all colors can be played at one time.
# The code breaker cannot see this arrangement.
#
# The code breaker places four colored pegs in the first row.
#
# The code maker uses key pegs to show the correctness of the guessed pattern.
# A red key peg indicates that the color is correct, and in the correct position.
# A white key peg indicates that the color does occur in the sequence, but not
# in that position. If the color does not appear at all in the sequence, the code
# maker does not use a key peg. The key pegs are not placed in any way that
# indicates which color pegs the key pegs correspond to.
#
# Game play continues by repeating steps 3 and 4 until the code breaker correctly
# guesses the code or all rows of the Mastermind board are filled without
# yielding a correct answer.
#
# Score the game. The code maker receives one point for each incorrect guess
# made by the code breaker. If the code breaker can prove that the code maker
# provided incorrect feedback, the code breaker receives three points and the
# code maker forfeits all points. If the game is finished without a correct
# answer, the code maker receives 11 points."
